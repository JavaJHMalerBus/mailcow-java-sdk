/**
 * This package and it's subpackages contain the model classes for the mailcow api. Most classes
 * cannot be instantiated directly; hence, there is a dedicated builder package containing builder
 * classes for each mailcow model. A great advantage of these builders is that model instances can
 * be fetched as well as created using the same builder.
 * The outward subpackage is mostly for internal use and you should not be required to use these classes
 * directly.
